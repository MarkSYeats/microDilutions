Description: The first function (micro_to_std) takes a numerical input for the concentration
(ng/µL) of your RNA/DNA sample and returns the concentration in g/L. The second function solves for v2 
(the final volume of the desired concentration, c2) then it finds the absolute difference between v1 and v2
(the volume of liquid needed in the sample to reach c2). The function the converts
that "volume to add" in to ng/µL, which will be the numerical value to set your pipette
to reach the final concentration, c2.
